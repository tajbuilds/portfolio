## Why edge services fail

Most edge services break because of inconsistent cache rules, weak validation, or hidden coupling to origin behavior.

## A practical checklist

- Treat cache policy as configuration, not code.
- Validate payloads at the edge before forwarding.
- Use staged rollouts with clear observability.

## What to measure

Latency, origin error rates, and cache hit ratio tell the real story. Keep metrics simple and review them after every change.
