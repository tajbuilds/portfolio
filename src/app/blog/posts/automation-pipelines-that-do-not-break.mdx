## The real failure mode

Automation does not fail at the happy path. It fails when suppliers change schemas, when payloads are missing fields, or when an upstream service times out.

## What works in practice

- Validate inputs early and log a clear reason on failure.
- Store raw payloads for replay and debugging.
- Separate detection from notification to avoid alert fatigue.

## A simple mindset

Assume every integration will change. Design for graceful degradation instead of brittle success.
