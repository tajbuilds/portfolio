## Overview

A Cloudflare Worker-based edge gateway that normalizes API requests, applies policy-driven caching, and improves performance and resilience for JSON APIs at scale.

## Highlights

- Canonical request normalization to maximize cache hit ratio and prevent cache fragmentation.
- Policy-driven caching with dynamic TTL decisions based on response characteristics and data freshness models.
- Multi-layer cache strategy (edge cache with optional durable storage) to reduce origin load and latency.
- Stale-on-error behavior to continue serving data during upstream failures.
- Observability built in: cache outcome classification, traceability, and performance metrics.
- Operational controls for bypassing cache and targeted purging during debugging or incidents.

## Tech

Cloudflare Workers, Cache API, KV, R2 (optional), JavaScript (ES modules), Cloudflare Analytics Engine.

## Outcome

- Improved API response times and consistency at the edge.
- Reduced origin traffic and upstream dependency during peak load.
- Increased resilience by serving cached or stale data during outages.
- Enabled scalable behavior changes through configuration rather than redeployments.
