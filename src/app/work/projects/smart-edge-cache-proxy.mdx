## Overview

A Cloudflare Worker that acts as an edge proxy with fine-grained cache control. Rules are stored in KV, enabling quick tuning without redeploys, with optional R2 persistence for large assets.

## Highlights

- KV-driven route rules with per-path TTL bands and bypass conditions.
- Safer defaults for cache headers and stale-while-revalidate strategies.
- Optional R2 storage for edge-friendly persistence and cost control.

## Tech

Cloudflare Workers, KV, R2, JavaScript.

## Outcome

Reduced origin load and delivered consistent edge performance while keeping configuration simple to update.
